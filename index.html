            <h2>Rome</h2>
            <img src="download.jpg">
            <p> Rome, the city of seven hills, enjoyed a mythic beginning. Romulus and Remus – twin brothers who were nursed by a she-wolf and fathered by a war god – reportedly founded the Eternal City. And although historians are a little skeptical about this epic entry into the world, most travelers are absolutely certain that there is something magical about Rome. Whether it's the mystery of nearby Vatican City or the ghosts of the Colosseum, an afternoon caffè on Piazza Navona or a piled-high plate of pasta at a trattoria, Rome is sure to enchant.</p>

                <h2>London, England</h2>
                    <img src="london.jpg" title="london" alt="image of london">
                    <p>The English writer Samuel Johnson famously said, "You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford." More than two centuries have passed since Johnson's era, but his words still ring true. Life in London is nothing short of invigorating, and travelers find that one visit isn't enough to experience everything this two-millennia-old city has to offer.

                    Here, the antiquated clasps hands with the contemporary. You'll find the historic Tower of London and the avant-garde Tate Modern. You can catch both the Bard's works and modern plays at Shakespeare's Globe and its accompanying Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. And while Londoners still praise the power of tea, they now make room for Starbucks and Costa Coffees here and there, and pressed juice too. A current leader in everything from politics and banking to fashion and music, London's culture compass is always attuned to what's next. Discover it all on one of London's best tours.<br/>

                <h2>Turks & Caicos</h2>
                <img src="turks.jpg" title="Turks-Caicos" alt="image of Turks-Caicos">
                <p>The Turks & Caicos Islands have the perfect antidote for your hectic lifestyle: nearly abandoned, blindingly white sand fringed by shimmering azure water, colorful coral reefs, crispy conch fritters and a sleepy, lighthearted atmosphere. While the destructive hurricanes of 2017 did impact the island, much of the damage has been repaired and its beaches are still as stunning as ever. Turks & Caicos holds tight to its reputation as an exclusive and secluded getaway. And regular vacationers to these skinny strips of alabaster sand will tell you that they wouldn't have it any other way.

                This network of roughly 100 islands and cays has three dominant personalities. There's glamorous Providenciales, or "Provo," which shelters a bevy of luxurious hotels. Laid-back Grand Turk is the historic and cultural nucleus (and cruise ship hub), best seen in the Turks & Caicos National Museum or along the shores of Cockburn Town, where Christopher Columbus first docked in the Western Hemisphere. Tiny, flat Salt Cay plays host to the best dives: From here, you can explore one of the largest reef systems in the world.<br>
